# Smart-Loan-Recovery-System  
Developed a machine learning model to predict whether overdue loans are likely to be recovered or turn into losses, addressing a crucial business problem for banks and financial institutions. Unlike traditional loan approval models, this project focuses on the post-loan disbursement phase, where significant financial risks occur.
The solution enables banks to prioritize recovery efforts, optimize collection strategies, and minimize potential losses, directly improving profitability and risk management.
